# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is pre-1.0. Security fixes land on `main`; please track the
latest commit.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security problems. Instead, use
GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ahmeddoghri/taggate/security/advisories/new)
or email the maintainer. Include a description of the issue and its impact,
steps to reproduce (a minimal proof-of-concept helps), and any suggested
remediation.

You can expect an initial acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is
available it will be released and you will be credited unless you prefer to
remain anonymous.

## Scope notes

`taggate` has no runtime dependencies and makes no network calls on its
own, so there isn't much attack surface until you add some. When you wire
in your own model or tagging backend, that component's security posture
is your responsibility. Validate and sanitize any untrusted content you
route through the pipeline.
